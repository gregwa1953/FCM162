# FCM162 Code



This repository contains the code for my Python article to be published the end of October 2020.

Please simply clone or download the repository to follow along with the article.

Due to the number and type of files required for the article for this month, I decided to go this route rather than my normal **pastebin.com** routine.

If it works out for everyone, I might start using it on a more regular basis.  Either way, I always have this as an option to provide more complex articles and projects for the future.



Please enjoy!
